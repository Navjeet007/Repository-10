Modify class Date of Fig. 8.7 to perform error checking on the initializer values for instance variables month, day and year (currently it validates only the month and day). Provide a method nextDay to increment the day by one. The Date object should remain in a consistent state. Write a program that tests method nextDay in a loop that prints the date during each iteration to illustrate that the method works correctly. Test the following cases: a) incrementing into the next month and b) incrementing into the next year.
